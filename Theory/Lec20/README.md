# Std misc
## Thread 
+ Rust provides a mechanism for spawning native OS threads via the `spawn` function, the argument of this function is a moving `closure`.

## Channel
+ Rust provides asynchronous `channels` for communication between threads.
+ Channels allow a unidirectional flow of information between two end-points: the `Sender` and the `Receiver`.
