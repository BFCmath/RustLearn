# Rust-analyzer
+ Suggest error in code (they can also suggest how to fix it - very strong)
+ Can only be used with Cargo.toml
+ Effective way to use it is using `cargo new`. Check [Lec1](Theory/Lec1/README.md), [Lec12](Theory/Lec12/README.md) or check this [video](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=using+rust-analyzer+on+vscode&mid=3DD28A771A9BCB0FA9823DD28A771A9BCB0FA982&FORM=VIRE)
