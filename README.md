# Learn Rust
Welcome to my Rust self-learning repository! This repository serves as a personal tracker for my progress in learning Rust, combining both theory and practice.
## Resources
+ **Theory**: Follow the official Rust documentation [here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html).
+ **Practice**: Work through exercises from the [Rustlings repository](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings).

Special thanks to my friends Nho and Khoa for accompanying me.

## Installation
To get started with Rust on Windows:
+ Follow the official installation guide [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
+ Consider trying Rust without Visual Studio (TBD).
+ Install the `rust-analyzer` extension in Visual Studio Code (VSC).


## Rust-analyzer
The `rust-analyzer` extension is a powerful tool that:
+ Suggests errors in your code and often provides fixes.
+ Requires a *Cargo.toml* file to function.
+ Is most effectively used by creating projects with `cargo new`. For examples, see [Lec1](Theory/Lec1/README.md) and [Lec12](Theory/Lec12/README.md) or watch this [video tutorial](https://www.bing.com/videos/riverview/relatedvideo?q=using+rust-analyzer+on+vscode&mid=3DD28A771A9BCB0FA9823DD28A771A9BCB0FA982&FORM=VIRE) 

## Instruction 
This repository is intended to track my personal progress in learning Rust. However, if you find it useful, feel free to use it as a learning resource.

## Theory
The notes in this repository summarize key concepts from the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html).

**NOTE for learner**:
+ A prior knowledge of programming is recommended.
+ Familiarity with C++, Python, or JavaScript can be very helpful.
+ These notes are mainly intended for revising concepts before tackling *exercises*.
+ Some sections are marked as *TBD* and may be covered in the future. For more detailed information, refer to the [Rust documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html).
+ Itâ€™s recommended to read from the beginning, as some lectures build on concepts covered in earlier ones.
